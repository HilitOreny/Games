Hello there!


I started programming in March 2020. 
I was in lockdown because of COVID-19 pandemic, and decided to challenge myself and learn Python.

I created some simple classic games as a demonstration of my skills.

My games are free to use.
I do not collect any personal information on the players.

Please play them, and have fun!
They are suitable for children and adults alike.


Thank you for reading and have a wonderful day!
