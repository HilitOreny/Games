a loop creates multiple turns for the same game.
First, a secret word is chosen and presented on the screen.
Afterwards, in each turn, the user suggests a letter.
If the user's input is not valid,
the program prints an error and urges the user to suggest a different input.
Then, a string contains letters and underscores is presented on the screen.
As the loop runs, the user suggests more letters and sees the letters he/she already guessed.
The loop breaks when the user wins or loses.
The user wins when he/she finds all the letters of the secret word.
The user loses the game in the sixth mistake.
